# Newsletter-signup


This Node.js web application, using Express and the Mailchimp API, allows users to sign up for a mailing list. 
The server handles POST requests from a signup form, sends user data to the Mailchimp API for subscription, and dynamically redirects users to a success or failure page based on the API response.
