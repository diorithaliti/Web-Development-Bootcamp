This game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery. It leverages event listeners to respond to user input, dynamically generates and displays sequences of button colors, and checks the user's pattern against the generated sequence. The game includes sound effects and visual animations, keeping track of the player's level and highest record while providing feedback for correct and incorrect responses. The restart functionality is triggered on incorrect sequences, allowing the player to restart the game and attempt to beat their record. The game's core logic is encapsulated in functions for clarity and maintainability.
