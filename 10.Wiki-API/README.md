# Wiki-API

Wiki App sets up a basic RESTful API using Express and MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on articles.
It defines routes to handle requests for retrieving all articles, adding a new article, deleting all articles, and managing specific articles by title (retrieve, update, patch, delete).
